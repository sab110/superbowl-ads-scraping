Brief – Scraping: Club des DA

Hi Muhammad,

Our next website to scrape is:
🔗 leclubdesda.org/archives

It’s a French website — if you need help understanding anything, feel free to ask.

Objective:

Scrape all available data from 1969 to today.

Data structure:

Please keep exactly the same JSON structure as before.
I’m attaching a JPEG with the variables to use, to help guide you.

Specific rules to apply:
	•	For the award title variable, can you automatically replace the French labels with their English equivalents?
	•	“1er Prix” → Gold
	•	“2ème Prix” → Silver
	•	“3ème Prix” → Bronze
	•	“SHORTLIST” → Shortlist
	•	For the country variable, please always use France.

I’m still reviewing the full data delivery for the EPICA website — there are a lot of files so it will take me a bit of time. I’ll confirm the delivery as soon as I’ve gone through everything.

If you’re OK with it, feel free to send me a new offer for the Club des DA project at $100.

Thanks again,
