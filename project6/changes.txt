Hello, thank you very much for this first piece of work.
I'm not sure if it's related, but I think we should start scraping the data from 2025 and then go backward to 2012, because | believe some data is missing in the older years, which might be slowing down the script.
For example, the page https:/l.
www.unblock.coffee/campaign/connecting=
lifelines/ doesn't open on my side.
Overall, I think it's good - I just noticed two small errors on the right side of the credits, which are not being taken into account.
Also, please don't use hyphens ("-") in the folder names for the categories.
