Hi! I hope you’re doing well.
I’ve got a new scraping brief ready for you, this time for the website adsoftheworld.com. I’ve prepared all the details in the JPEG file attached.

One quick note regarding the naming of the video/media files: I noticed you’ve been using underscores instead of spaces. However, for consistency with the databases I already have, we need to use spaces in the filenames just like you did for the Super Bowl project.

In the Epica and Club des DA scrapes, you used underscores, so I’ve included an example in the brief to show exactly how I format my filenames.

Let me know if you have any questions before starting.

Also, feel free to send me a new $100 project request so we can launch this task. 

Looking forward to your feedback!
